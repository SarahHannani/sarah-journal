      Hi! Iâ€™m Sarah. Welcome to my online journal. A space to dump thoughts and share side quests.

  <h2>ðŸŒ· About Me</h2>
  <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Sarah! Iâ€™m 25, based in Malaysia, and currently on a side quest to learn coding â€” even though I donâ€™t work in tech (yet!).</p>
  
  <p>This little site started as a mini HTML project but slowly became my cozy digital journal.</p>

  <p>I love swimming, solo travel, and the kind of shopping that makes your bank account cry. I'm also trying to spend less time on TikTok and more time building something real. So here we are.</p>

  <p>Thanks for being here. This is a safe space. For now, it's mostly about thoughts, random rants, and tiny wins ðŸ’–</p>

      Actually I learned how to do simple HTML coding back in 2017 - in my science computer 	class in highschool. It was NOT fun back then, because we had to study for SPM along 	with completing the HTML project. 
    </p>
    <p>
	I decided to do this again last week with very limited knowledge. What I did was go 	thorugh the HTML W3 Schools and build it from scratch, googling all the "how to". 	Then I asked Chatgpt to review my code and it was horrible HAHA but it amazingly 	works well. So this is the refined version from Chatgpt. 
    </p>

    <p>
So this is it, my one page journal. I hope to add into this everyday, and refined my HTML+CSS+Java skills along the way.
